***PRIORITY ORDER***

- Questions answered pages. Answering a question takes you to the questions answered page

- Social Integration:
    - Users should be able to share questions via Facebook, Twitter and Google+, but I need to discuss this with you first
    - "Sarah said I can go have some beers with the boys" -> Social Networks
    - Answerer shares

/honeys/{honey} -> Birds eye view of questions they answered and stuff

- Sort timestamps out for user links and requests
- System timezone and user timezones
- Make the social links at the bottom of the homepage go somewhere :|

    - On the homepage put a 'How it works' section
    - ENCRYPTION:
        - I need to look into this some more, but on the site you mentioned encryption. For this we need SSL certificates which I will look
          into setting up on my server, I will have to look into how to store the information securely. Possibly using the user's password
          as the encryption key, and enforcing strong passwords.
    - Send confirmation emails about my account changes and a welcome email.
    - AJAX for checking if a user exists and requesting them as a friend would be ideal.
    - Nicer email formatting
    - Massively clean up the CSS and Javascript files
    - Password reset code expiry
    - Modal dialogues
    - Pagination
    - Maybe make the inbox contain also notifications?
    - Make the error pages more informative (and make more of them)
    - Maybe a search feature
    - Make tables sortable by column
    - Pie charts using Chart.js
    - Make routes more.like.this thanThis_or_this
    - answered_at column for Question Asked
